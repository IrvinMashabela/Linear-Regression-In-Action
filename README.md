# Ames Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regression Analysis

A comprehensive machine learning project that builds a multiple linear regression model to predict housing prices using the Ames, Iowa housing dataset. This project demonstrates the complete data science workflow from data cleaning to model evaluation.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the Ames Housing dataset to predict house sale prices based on key property features. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, linear regression modeling, and model evaluation to understand the relationship between property characteristics and sale prices.
